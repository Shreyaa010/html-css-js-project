Create an image search app that lets you search for any desired image. You can enter your search query and receive results accompanied by a description. The app is responsive and displays images in a single column on smaller ones. Using the Unsplash API, the app fetches up to 1000 unique and non-repetitive images. The modern CSS design ensures a fast and responsive user experience, making it enjoyable to search for cats, dogs, or any image.# html-css-js-project
